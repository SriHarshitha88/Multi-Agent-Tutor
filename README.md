# 🤖 Multi-Agent AI Tutor System

A smart AI tutoring system with specialized agents for different subjects, powered by Google Gemini. The system uses a coordinator agent that intelligently routes questions to specialist agents (Math, Physics) which can utilize tools like equation solvers and formula lookups to provide accurate, educational responses. With session-based context history, the system maintains conversation memory for more personalized and coherent multi-turn interactions.

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Math Problems

**Input**: "Solve the equation 3x + 7 = 22"

**Response**:
```
To solve 3x + 7 = 22:
1. Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15
2. Divide both sides by 3: x = 5

Therefore, x = 5 is the solution.
```

### Multi-turn Conversation with Context

**First Input**: "What is kinetic energy?"

**Response**:
```
Kinetic energy is the energy an object possesses due to its motion. 
It's calculated using the formula KE = ½mv², where m is mass and v is velocity.
```

**Second Input**: "Can you explain the formula in more detail?" (using same session_id)

**Response**:
```
Certainly! Looking at the kinetic energy formula KE = ½mv²:

- The ½ is a constant factor in the equation
- m represents mass in kilograms (kg)
- v² means velocity squared in (m/s)²

The squared velocity term means that doubling the speed quadruples the kinetic energy!
```

### Biology Questions

**Input**: "What is the difference between mitosis and meiosis?"

**Response**:
```
Mitosis and meiosis are both types of cell division, but they have different purposes and outcomes:

Mitosis:
- Produces two identical daughter cells
- Maintains chromosome number (diploid to diploid)
- Used for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction
- One division cycle

Meiosis:
- Produces four genetically diverse cells
- Reduces chromosome number (diploid to haploid)
- Used for sexual reproduction (gamete formation)
- Two division cycles with crossing over
```

### Physics Concepts

**Input**: "What is the formula for kinetic energy?"

**Response**:
```
The formula for kinetic energy is:

KE = ½mv²

Where:
- KE is kinetic energy in Joules (J)
- m is mass in kilograms (kg)
- v is velocity in meters per second (m/s)

This formula shows that kinetic energy increases with mass, but increases with the square of velocity.
```
